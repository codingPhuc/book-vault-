Step.1.begins.by.building.a.one-entity.diagram.. 
- one entity diagram is a diagram that is only contain the information of a single entity it can be then combine with other entity to create a database 

Step.2.concentrates.on.using.structured.English.to.describe.a.database.. 

Step.3,.the.last.section.in.this.chapter,.discusses.mapping.the.ER.diagram.to.a. relational.database

## DATA MODELING SCHEMA 
allow us to model or illustract the database 

# what is a ER 
Entry relation is a tool to abstractly describing or portraying data  which is the conceptual model ,   the conceptual model will lead us to a schema which will result in a fixed description of our data 
## Some definition  an Entity , Relationship , Attribute  

an entities is "some thing that can be identify " think of it like a noun in the english vocabulary  thing that have clear meaning in it definition 
a relationship is the connection form between different entity  
an attribute is   data that describe the entity and there relationship 

Entity  : 
- an entity should  be in the middle of generic meaning it should not be specific like  open a donut shop so donut entities (the buiness might change so no) instead replace with pastry entities (this include all pastry and accommodate  changes ) 
- the entity should avoid computer device oriented term like file or record specifcally from a computer device or data bases storage devices 
- there are two type of naming term for entities specialize and generalize , a person is a generalize term while a student is specialize 
- instance is a way of capturing data thing of it like a newly created row in an entity table a screw driver is  an instance of tool with it own set of different attribute but same relation  
	- each instance should have it own ID which identify the instance 
- relationship is a link or association between entities , we began by the notation of the entities and then come back to the notation of the relationship 
- attribute is a property of characteristic of a property
