# Definition  
High performance computing (HPC) is the practice of aggregating computing resources to gain performance greater than that of a single workstation, server, or computer. HPC can take the form of custom-built supercomputers or groups of individual computers called clusters. HPC can be run on-premises, in the cloud, or as a hybrid of both. Each computer in a cluster is often called a node, with each node responsible for a different task. Controller nodes run essential services and coordinate work between nodes, interactive nodes or login nodes act as the hosts that users log in to, either by graphical user interface or command line, and compute or worker nodes execute the computations. Algorithms and software are run in parallel on each node of the cluster to help perform its given task. HPC typically has three main components: compute, storage, and networking.




Here’s a summarized version of the key points about getting into HPC (High-Performance Computing):

### 1. **Learn Linux Thoroughly**

- Linux is foundational for HPC. Understand it backwards and forwards, as HPC systems rely on it.

### 2. **Focus on Key Areas in HPC**

- **HPC Administration**: Involves managing job schedulers, resource allocation, and system troubleshooting.
- **Cluster Management**: Requires knowledge of Linux OS, high-speed networking (e.g., InfiniBand, RDMA), and system performance.
- **HPC Storage Engineering**: Focuses on large-scale, low-latency storage across clusters.

### 3. **Gain Hands-On Experience**

- If possible, get an internship or student job at your university’s HPC center.
- Alternatively, seek internships at national labs or research institutes that use HPC.
- Learn parallel programming, which is crucial for optimizing performance.

### 4. **Understand Hardware and Performance**

- Learn how CPUs, memory subsystems, and accelerators (e.g., GPUs like H100) work.
- Gain deep knowledge of storage systems, interconnects (like InfiniBand), and parallel filesystems (e.g., MPI-IO, RDMA).
- Study modern deployment tools (e.g., xCAT, Puppet) and how to optimize supercomputer resource usage.

### 5. **Specialized Skills**

- Learn about **parallel programming**, **scientific pipelines**, and performance observability.
- Understand the impact of memory, networking, and job scheduling on performance.

### 6. **Optional but Useful Skills**

- Learn **Python**, a key language for scripting and automation.
- Understand **networking** fundamentals and **Git** for version control.
- Familiarize yourself with Kubernetes, a tool for container orchestration, and other automation tools.
- Take courses like MIT’s “Missing Semester” to fill in gaps in job readiness.

### 7. **Soft Skills**

- Good communication is key—being able to explain technical issues clearly, especially when dealing with researchers or users of the HPC system.

In short: **Linux mastery**, practical experience, and a focus on system architecture, networking, and performance are crucial for a career in HPC.
