# Chart 

## line chart 
there is two type of line chart : 
- 2 line chart type 
- more than 3 line chart type
Analysis of the chart , there is 3 thing you need to consider before talking about the line chart : 
Topic - what is the object of the chart ? 
- Average carbon dioxide emissions per person 
Place - Where are the figure in the chart taken? 
- in 4 countries 
Number of factors - What is the number of objects mentioned in the chart ? 
- 4 factors mentions 
Time - When are figures in the chart taken 
- From 1967 to 2007 including 5 timelines 

if it is in the past then used [[writting#Simple Past Tense]]  if it in the future then used [[writting#Future Tense]] if it in the present then continuing then used [[writting#Future Tense]]

### Overview 
general trend of line in the graph does these lines move up or down has it change in some way 
find distinct line in the chart show which line change the most which part have the lowest or highest data 
you are not allow to include specific data 
you should write 1 sentences about the data then add in more detail with linking word future more additionally 

### Body 
#### comparing timeline 
compare the timeline together like you can split the timeline into half and half so that you can easily compare them together .   
you need to describe the change in trend in each line and describe the line in detail 
#### you should group the line into trend 
compare the line bases on similar trend and setting like a group of line going up in one period of time 
Example : 
```
- **Body 1:** In 1967, about 11 tonnes of CO2 were generated by a UK citizen, followed by 9 tonnes in Sweden. For comparison, each Italian emits more than 4 tonnes, about three times more than the Portuguese.
    
- **Body 2:** From that point on, the average CO2 emissions in the UK gradually fell below 9 tonnes while the figure in Sweden, after increasing by 1 tonne in the first decade, also fell moderately to less than 6 tonnes at the end of the decade period. In contrast, each person in Italy emits more CO2 with a figure that increased to almost 8 tonnes in 2007, compared with an equally significant increase of about 6 tonnes in Portugal.
```
here the line chart is divided into trend with downward trend  of Sweden and UK and upward trend of Italy and Portugal 
the 1 body describe trend at the beginning while the second describe trend at the end 
each timeline used decade instead of the exact year 

### word to describe

## Pie Chart 
### Pie chart concept  
pie chart is a circular image divided into many part using color , each section is mark by a number as a percentage  
this is used to compare different between subject at different time interval 


### there are two different type of pie chart 
![[Pasted image 20240622112211.png]] 
Dynamic pie chart which  change over time  
static chart which depict just one subject there is no comparison between the chart 

### Overview 
similar to other type of chart highlight two factor that seem to affect the chart the most 
trend  : write out figure that tend to decrease or increase  
magnitude : which section or factor in the chart take up the most space the which factor take up the lowest 

Example : 
"Overall, at the beginning of the period construction contributed the least to the economy of Turkey and agriculture was the most significant economic sector. In comparison, at the end of the period healthcare and education became the largest economic segment and the lowest contribution was made by financial, business and other services"
here the magnitude of the overview focus on which sector is the majority , taking up the most space 
and the trend represent how the contribution change over time 
### body 

there are two method to divide the body of a paragraph 
first is to divide it by year 
second is to divide it by object 

if the question only give a single pie chart present the info from smallest to largest 
if the question give more than two paragraph  , you can present the information the following way : 
- first see the changes in the pie chart between the beginning pie chart and the end pie chart . These change can be represented by symbol like upward and downward arrow 
- group each section in your explanation, meaning to group section in pie chart that have similar name together ,like a economy pie chart would have a service section in the beginning and end pie chart  then group the economy section in the pie chart from the beginning to end together 


### write pie chart as static chart 

#### Overview  
in a static pie chart you will analyze the magnitude of each part in the pie chart like which part take up the largest amount etc 
analyzing something like the lowest amount spend the largest amount ... 

example :
```
Overally, the UAE government's maximum spending went in social security and healthcare sectors while the least amounts were spent on transport, law and order, housing and industry/agriculture and employment sectors.
```
here the UAE magnitude highlight the spending in social security and health care sector  , while the transport sector have the least amount etc so it just highlight what is the biggest and what is the smallest 

#### body 
you should arrange the body into different section  form the largest magnitude to the lowest magnitude .There is also a method to arrange the information into the same group 

```
According to the pie chart, the UAE administration allocated AED 100 billion in social security from their national budget of AED 315 billion. This single sector costs the UAE government almost one-third of the total budget. This year the government's expense was 53 million on health and personal social services, which was the second largest sector in terms of expenditure made by the UAE government. 38 million AED was spent on education while 23 billion both in debt and other expenditures.

The government used 22 billion in the Defense sector while 15 billion of the budget was spent on housing and the environment. Next, the government spent 13 billion for the industry, employment agriculture and sectors. Finally, The lowest amount of money, only 9 billion, went to the transport sector.
``` 
here the writer first showcase the overall budget and the sector that spend the most money in . and trickle down from second largest to smallest sector 
percentages to fractions that candidates can apply:



|**Percentage**|**Score**|
|---|---|
|80%|four-fifths|
|75%|three-quarters|

|52%|Approximately half|
|49%|just under a half / nearly a half|
|32%|almost a third|
|19%|nearly a fifth|

|**Percentage**|**amount / proportion / number**|

**Overview:** 

- Nêu ra những điểm nổi bật của biểu đồ: 

=> Giá đồng và niken sụt giảm, trong đó niken có mức biến động cao nhất.

=> Kẽm có mức tăng vừa phải, thay đổi ít quyết liệt hơn.

The provided line chart illustrates the **fluctuations** in monthly prices for **copper**, **nickel**, and **zinc** throughout the year 2014.

Overall, the prices of copper and nickel witnessed declines, with nickel exhibiting the highest **volatility** among them. On the other hand, zinc experienced a **moderate** increase. As the period progressed, the changes became less **drastic**, indicating a **stabilization** in the market.

In January 2014, nickel exhibited a **substantial** month-to-month percentage change of 6%, **surpassing** both copper (2%) and zinc (1%) by a significant margin. However, this trend for nickel reversed in the following months, as the percentage changes dropped to 1% by March and reached a low of -3% by June. The **divergences** observed in the other metals were **comparatively** more moderate. Zinc experienced its highest change of 3% in February before entering a declining trend throughout the first half of the year. Similarly, copper prices also declined, with changes mostly ranging around 1% to -1%, slightly lower compared to the other metals.

During the second half of the year, nickel production experienced a decline, with most months seeing a decrease of -1%. However, towards the end of the year, there was a notable **upturn** as nickel prices rose, resulting in 1% increases. In contrast, copper prices remained relatively **steady**, **hovering** around 1% from July onwards, with a slight upward trend observed in December. Zinc, on the other hand, saw a slight decline of 0.5% for the majority of the **latter** part of the year, but it ended on a high note with a **surge** of 2% in December. This marked the highest ending point among all metal prices.

# MAP 

#### Introduction 

**Tip 1: Using Synonyms, Antonyms, and Different Forms of Words**

This approach is indeed beneficial for those with a robust vocabulary. It involves substituting words with their synonyms or antonyms without altering the original meaning. For instance:

- Original: The map shows the development over the years.
- Paraphrased: The diagram illustrates the progression through the decades.

**Tip 2: Changing the Sentence Structure Without Changing the Meaning**

This technique involves altering the grammatical structure of the sentence while retaining its meaning. It can include switching between active and passive voice, using introductory phrases, or reordering the components of the sentence. For example:

- Original: There has been a significant increase in urban development in the city over the last decade.
- Paraphrased: Over the past ten years, the city has experienced a marked escalation in urban growth.

When you mention changing from “V+to+adj” to “adj+to+V,” it seems you’re referring to changing the order of words within the sentence. This can be part of restructuring the sentence, but it’s important to ensure that the new structure still makes sense and retains the original meaning. For example:

- Original: It is essential to address the issue.
- Paraphrased: Addressing the issue is essential.
After practicing the above 2 tips of IDP, you can use some common opening sentence patterns such as:
- The maps + V + how changed + Time = The maps + V + the changes of + [Place] + Time, where:
    
    - V: show/illustrate/demonstrate
        
    - Time: over a [number of years]-year period from___ to___/ between___ and___
        
- The given table presents/ witness/ shows 
    
- Use relational clauses
    
- Use linking words such as: Even though, In spite of, Because, However,...

![[Pasted image 20240610173248.png]]
_The Map chart shows the change in the public park when it first opened in 1920 and the current park._

**Topic:** The maps below show a public park when it first opened in 1920 and the same park today.

**Sample Introduction:** The two maps illustrate various changes Grange park has undergone since its opening in 1920 to the present.

 In the above example, synonyms such as: show = illustrate; today = the present 

#### Overview 


When you’re asked to focus on the “where,” “how,” and “why,” you’re being guided to address:

- **Where** the change has taken place (the location or aspect of the map).
- **How** the change has occurred (the process or nature of the change).
- **Why** the change has happened (the reasons or factors behind the change).
You can use some of the following phrases and structures to write the Overview:

- S + V + Change [major changes/ striking transformations/ a significant modernization/ remarkable developments/]. V can be [see/ witness/ experience/ show/ display/present]
    
- Most noticeably, S+V → refers to the most prominent change. Can be noticeably replaced with other words such as striking, conspicuous, prominent, remarkable, outstanding, salient,... 
Remember, the introduction should succinctly present the key changes without going into detailed descriptions, which are reserved for the body of the article. The overview should highlight the most prominent changes to give the reader a clear picture of the map’s evolution.
- **S** stands for the **subject** of the sentence. In the context of your task, the subject would typically be the map or the specific elements within the map that are undergoing changes.
- **V** represents the **verb**, which describes the action or state of the subject. In this case, verbs like “see,” “witness,” “experience,” “show,” “display,” or “present” would be used to describe the observation or changes noted in the map.
- **Change** refers to the **description of the transformation** that has taken place, such as “major changes,” “striking transformations,” “a significant modernization,” “remarkable developments,” and so on.



Here’s how you might structure an introduction using these elements:

```markdown
**Introduction:**
As can be seen from the map, the island has undergone **striking transformations** over the years. 

**Overview:**
Most noticeably, the previously undeveloped land has been **modernized** into a bustling hub of recreation and entertainment, showcasing a **remarkable development** from its original state.

**Map Analysis:**
The map **displays** a transition from a wild island to a well-facilitated destination, **evidencing** the **significant modernization** efforts undertaken.
```

In this example:

- **S** (subject) is the island.
- **V** (verb) includes words like “displays” and “evidencing.”
- **Change** is described with phrases like “striking transformations” and “significant modernization.”

#### Body  
The body of the paper usually consists of two paragraphs, each about 3-4 sentences long, which can be divided according to the two locations that the question considers, or divided according to the change of two time periods.
In the body of a map-based writing task, you should  focus on describing the location, explaining what the location is about, and detailing how the location has changed.

Here are some vocabulary suggestions for Writing Task 1 in Map form:

1. **Location-related words**: North, South, East, West, Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, Southwest, adjacent to, near, far, opposite, surrounding, central, peripheral, etc.
    
2. **Change-related words**: transformed, converted, evolved, developed, shifted, relocated, moved, altered, modified, etc.
    
3. **Description-related words**: residential area, commercial area, industrial area, natural features (like river, forest, hill, etc.), man-made features (like buildings, roads, bridges, etc.), facilities (like playground, parking lot, etc.)

**Example:** The entrance has also been relocated to the southwest corner of the building, next to the new reception desk and close to a new children's play area on the map.

- Location is being described: The entrance
    
- The venue is located in: in the southwest corner of the building, next to the new reception desk and close to a new children's play area.
    
- The change of location: has been relocated to the southwest corner of the building.
# process driven 

1. **Learn about the process**: Identify the type of process (natural or man-made), its starting and ending points, and whether it’s a closed or loop process. Determine the number of stages and their order, and understand the connection between each stage.
    
2. **Paraphrase the topic**: Restate the beginning point of the process in your own words to demonstrate understanding and avoid plagiarism.
    
3. **Overview the whole process**: Summarize the entire process in two sentences. This overview is crucial for scoring higher in the IELTS Writing Task as it shows your ability to condense information effectively.
    
4. **Divide the body**: For closed cycle processes, describe each step using the numbers assigned to the process. For processes with distinct starting and ending points, describe the steps in numerical order if they are numbered, or follow the sequence presented in the source material.
    
5. **Analyze section details**: Examine each step closely to identify the subject of the action, the action itself, the affected object, the purpose/cause of the step, the results, and compare the results if there are multiple outcome paths in the process.
    
6. **Review the article**: Re-read the article to check for sentence structure and spelling errors, ensuring clarity and accuracy in your writing
