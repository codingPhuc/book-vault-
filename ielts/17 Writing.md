## task  2
In our modern age , where our choices have grown to an exponential level ,creating more opportunity . Due to the growing number of choices people have been taking more risk in both their professional and personal lives to have a greater reward . This is an advantage in my opinion because people are now able to take more risk in pursuit of a better life 

When people say the word risk , all negative thoughts will  come spiraling into their head about danger and negativity associated with them . But it does not have to be this way ,risks are  tests of bravery , accepting a risk is equivalent to accepting a challenge , a challenge that will enable growth for the future. The people who partake in these risk will most likely gamble on a better future with more opportunity continually growing and changing to be better then they were before 

Risks enable a person to experience a new horizon, from their own safety bubble enabling them to understand themselves and their choices more clearly . An example of this is job hopping , job hopping enables hoppers to have more money when they are transitioning from their old and new working environment but this will come with its own set of risks, risks like will they fit into the company culture and can they adapt to their new job environment.... These risk 

may seem like alot , but if the reward and experience we gain from it out way the negative then it is understandable why people would choose to take such risks

So in conclusion , risks can be dangerous to take  but if we smartly weight out the  advantage and disadvantage combine with our own skill and ability we can safely take  them with minimum risks in the pursuit of a better life and our own development

The chart illustrates the weekly spending patterns of families in one country for the years 1968 and 2018. Overall, it is evident that in 1968, the largest portion of weekly income was spent on food, while in 2018, housing became the primary expenditure. Both years showed the least spending on fuel and power.

In 1968, families allocated around 35% of their weekly income to food, which is more than double the 15% spent by families in 2018. Conversely, spending on housing in 2018 was significantly higher, nearly doubling the 10% expenditure in 1968. Fuel and power costs remained relatively constant between the two years, with 1968 spending slightly over 5% and 2018 just under 5%.

Clothing and footwear expenses saw a dramatic decrease, with families in 1968 spending twice as much as those in 2018, at approximately 10% compared to 5%. Household goods expenditure remained fairly stable, with both years hovering just above 5%. In terms of personal goods, 1968 saw a higher expenditure at nearly 10%, whereas in 2018, it was halved to about 5%.

Transport expenditure increased significantly from below 10% in 1968 to nearly 15% in 2018. Lastly, spending on leisure activities more than doubled in 2018 compared to 1968, indicating a shift towards greater discretionary spending.

## Task 2 
### Evaluation of the Solution

**Score: 65/100**

**Strengths:**
1. **Clear Position:** You clearly stated your opinion that professionals should have the right to choose where they work.
2. **Discussion of Both Views:** You discussed both perspectives, which is crucial for this type of essay.
3. **Relevant Examples:** You provided examples such as Germany's guidelines and the opportunity for better life and opportunities, which helps support your argument.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Grammar and Spelling:**
   - There are several grammatical errors and misspellings that affect the clarity of the text. For example, "where they employed their profession" should be "where they employ their profession."
   - Incorrect subject-verb agreement, such as "Places like Germany who have strict guideline" should be "Places like Germany, which have strict guidelines."

2. **Structure and Coherence:**
   - The essay needs better structure. Each paragraph should have a clear topic sentence and develop one main idea.
   - The flow of ideas is sometimes disjointed. For example, "In My opinion I believe that a qualified professional should have the right to choose where they employed their profession" could be smoother.

3. **Complex Sentence Structure:**
   - The sentences are mostly simple and need more complexity to demonstrate a higher level of language proficiency.
   - Use linking words more effectively to show the relationship between ideas, such as "In contrast," "Furthermore," and "On the other hand."

4. **Vocabulary:**
   - The vocabulary is quite basic. Try to use more varied and advanced vocabulary to express your ideas.
   - For instance, "should not be restricted in movement" could be improved to "should not face geographical or bureaucratic restrictions."

5. **Relevance and Clarity of Ideas:**
   - Some ideas need more clarity and depth. For example, "People who have skills that do not have such a line of work in their home country" is confusing and needs to be rephrased for clarity.

6. **Concluding Sentence:**
   - The conclusion is brief and lacks a strong summarization of your points. Try to restate the main arguments and emphasize your opinion in a compelling way.

### Revised Answer

**Question:** Some people believe that professionals, such as doctors and engineers, should be required to work in the country where they did their training. Others believe they should be free to work in another country if they wish. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.

**Revised Solution:**

There is a debate on whether professionals, such as doctors and engineers, should be required to work in the country where they were trained or have the freedom to choose their place of employment. I believe that these skilled individuals should have the right to decide where they work.

**On one hand,** requiring professionals to work in their training country ensures that the investment in their education benefits the local community. For example, countries that subsidize education expect a return on their investment in the form of skilled labor that contributes to national development. Additionally, professionals trained locally are more familiar with the country's specific needs and regulations, which can lead to better service provision. For instance, a doctor trained in a tropical country may be better equipped to handle diseases prevalent in that region than a foreign doctor.

**On the other hand,** allowing professionals the freedom to work anywhere can lead to a more dynamic and innovative workforce. Individuals may seek opportunities in countries where their skills are in higher demand or where they can earn a better living. This mobility not only benefits the professionals but also the host countries, which gain access to a diverse pool of expertise. For example, many countries, such as the United States and Canada, have benefited from the influx of foreign-trained engineers and doctors who have significantly contributed to their healthcare and technological sectors.

**Moreover,** restricting professionals to their country of training can limit their career growth and personal aspirations. In an increasingly globalized world, professionals should be allowed to pursue opportunities that best fit their career goals and personal circumstances. For instance, an engineer from a developing country may find more advanced research opportunities in a developed country, which can lead to significant professional development and innovation.

**In conclusion,** while it is important for countries to benefit from their investment in education, professionals should have the autonomy to work where they feel their skills and contributions are most valued. This freedom not only promotes personal and professional growth but also fosters a more interconnected and resourceful global community.

### Linking Words Used:
1. **On one hand**
2. **For example**
3. **Additionally**
4. **On the other hand**

These linking words help to connect ideas and ensure a coherent and cohesive essay.

### Revised Sample

Here’s an example of a revised answer based on your input and suggestions:

---

The graph illustrates the number of shops that opened and closed in one country from 2011 to 2018. Overall, both shop openings and closures declined over this period, with closures showing more volatility compared to the steady decline in openings.

In 2011, shop openings were at their peak, nearly reaching 9,000, while closures were just above 6,000. By 2014, the number of shop openings had dropped significantly to about 4,000. During the same period, shop closures fluctuated between 6,000 and 7,000 before both metrics converged in 2014 at around 6,000.

In 2015, shop closures plummeted to their lowest point of approximately 500, but then rebounded significantly to about 5,000 the following year, where they remained relatively stable through to 2018. On the other hand, the number of new shop openings continued to decline gradually, reaching its lowest point in 2018 with around 3,000 openings.

In summary, the graph indicates a general downward trend for both shop closures and openings, with closures showing greater fluctuation while openings steadily decreased over the seven-year period.
