task 1 : 

The chart showcase the constrast between the ownership  of electrical  application and time spent on house work  in one country in a 99 year periot starting from  1920. The overall trend of the graph lean more toward a increase in house hold application from 1920 on ward and a decrease on time spent on house hold chore  
 
Starting from  the 1920 house hold electrical application took up a small percentage in each house hold , with the vacuum cleaner being non exitent and other applicant like washing machine and refrigerator taking up one fourth to one third of house hold. This all change in the year 1940 which saw the appearent of the vacuum cleaner and other applicant taking up half of all house hold. As the year gone by in the periot between 1940 and 2019 we can see that the washing machine have fructuated in used in the 60 to 70 percentage range , while the vacuum cleaner and the washing machine continue to reach their peak with a 100 percentage used in all house hold 
platuo 
The number of housework per week have had a steady decrease in the 1920 downward , this can be contributed to the increase in used of all house hold electrical appliances in the following year making house work activity more efficient  
 
**Task Achievement (7/9):** You’ve done a good job summarizing the main trends in the graph, including the increase in household appliance ownership and the decrease in time spent on housework. However, you could improve by making sure to fully address all parts of the prompt. For example, you could mention specific data points or years to provide a more detailed overview.

**Coherence and Cohesion (6/9):** Your ideas are logically organized and you’ve used a range of cohesive devices (“Starting from”, “This all changed”, “As the year gone by”). However, there are some instances where the flow of ideas could be improved. For example, the transition between the description of appliance ownership and time spent on housework could be smoother.

**Lexical Resource (7/9):** You’ve used a variety of vocabulary related to the topic, which is great. However, there are some inaccuracies (“applicants” instead of “appliances”, “used” instead of “use”). Make sure to proofread your work to catch these errors.

**Grammatical Range and Accuracy (6/9):** You’ve used a mix of simple and complex sentences, which is good. However, there are several grammatical errors that affect the clarity of your writing. For example, “the washing machine have fluctuated in used” should be “the use of the washing machine has fluctuated”.


Task 2 : 
The image poses two key questions:

1. What are the reasons for people becoming more interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in?
    
2. How can people research this history?
    

To address these questions, I will focus my response strictly on extracting and summarizing the key points from the text, without providing any additional interpretation or commentary.


There is a growing trend among house owners . The trend  is about knowing about the history of one's own house or building apartment that they live in. But why is this trend popular and where can people find out more about their houses historical value 

  

The growing trend of wanting to find the history of one house  has contributed to the fact that most people just want to find more meaning in the house they live in . This meaning is what leads them to discover more history or value in their house , an effect like this is similar to going to an auction house to find the true value of an item , in this case people are wanting to find more value in their house. Values such as the importance of the house resident , the history of the time the house existed and its ability to stand the test of time. 

  

There is many way to search for house history. One way is through the internet , now day people can just type their houses name and address online to see if there is a wiki page or information about the house history . Another way is talking with the local resident in the house's neighborhood , the resident who lives there the longest can surely tell you about how the house was made , who lived in the house before or even the year it began construction . But the common way is through the house document , if you bought the house from its previous owner then they should have paper detailing the house structure, its history and how it came to be . 

  

So in conclusion, this growing trend is mostly due to people wanting to find more value or meaning in the properties that they register in. After finding the meaning people will have a sense of belonging to the house making it a more meaningful home , enabling people to be more motivated when taking care or looking after the house

Task 1  : 

 **havesting  harvesting harvesting harvesting harvesting harvesting harvesting harvesting harvesting harvesting harvesting harvesting harvesting harvesting harvesting harvesting harvesting harvesting 

 refrienment refinement refinement refinement refinement refinement refinement refinement refinement refinement 

 Limstone limestone limestone limestone limestone limestone limestone limestone limestone limestone limestone limestone**

The diagram illustrate the process of making sugar from sugar cane from  the beginning harvest to the refinement end  


The process is split into  7 total step from the harvesting and extracting the sugar cane  juices , to the refinement of the sugar cane juices into sugar  

  

In the first three steps of the process the sugar cane is the harvesting and extracting state of the sugar cane. In the first step the sugar cane is in it growing period which last about 12 to 18 month , then when the sugar cane have fully mature they will be harvested either by a farmer or a machine  , then to the third step it will be crushed by a machine to created sweet juices 

  

The 4 last step is the refinement of the sugar cane into  sugar. here after the sugar cane have been crush in the 3 step they will then be filter by a limestone filter , then in the firth step be evaporated into syrup , then pass on to the centrifuge so that the sugar crystal can be separated from the syrup and finally the last and seven step be left to dry and cool down in a container



Writing Task 1 criteria:


**Task Achievement**: You’ve provided an overview of the process and included all the main stages. However, the details are somewhat limited, and there are some inaccuracies. For instance, you mentioned “the sugar cane is the harvesting and extracting state of the sugar cane,” which is a bit confusing. It’s important to clearly differentiate each step and describe it accurately.

**Coherence and Cohesion**: Your answer has a logical order, but there are issues with repetition and some awkward phrasing. Using a variety of conjunctions and transition words can help improve the flow of information.

**Lexical Resource**: You’ve used a range of vocabulary related to the process, which is good. However, there’s room for using more precise terms and synonyms to avoid repetition.

**Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: There are several grammatical errors, including verb tense consistency and article usage. Paying attention to these details can significantly improve your score.

Based on these observations, I would rate your solution around **60 out of 100**. To improve, consider the following tips:

- **Detail each step** more precisely, using the correct technical terms.
- **Avoid repetition** by using synonyms and varying your sentence structures.
- **Check your grammar**, especially verb tenses and the use of articles (“a,” “an,” and “the”).
- **Clarify your ideas** by ensuring each sentence has a clear subject and actio

Improving coherence and cohesion in your writing involves creating a clear and logical flow of ideas. Here are some specific strategies to help you fix issues with repetition and awkward phrasing:

1. **Use Synonyms and Paraphrasing**: Avoid using the same words repeatedly. Instead, use synonyms or rephrase sentences to convey the same meaning. For example, instead of saying “sugar cane” multiple times, you could use “the crop,” “these plants,” or “cane stalks.”
    
2. **Vary Sentence Structures**: Mix simple, compound, and complex sentences to make your writing more interesting. This also helps to avoid monotonous patterns.
    
3. **Logical Sequencing**: Make sure each sentence flows logically to the next. Use sequencing words like “firstly,” “secondly,” “subsequently,” “finally,” etc., to guide the reader through the steps.
    
4. **Transition Words and Phrases**: Use transitions to connect ideas within and between paragraphs. Words like “however,” “moreover,” “therefore,” and “as a result” can show contrast, addition, cause, and effect.
    
5. **Referencing**: Use pronouns and determiners to refer back to previously mentioned ideas, which helps to tie sentences together. For example, “this method,” “such an approach,” “these steps,” etc.
    
6. **Topic Sentences and Signposting**: Start each paragraph with a clear topic sentence that indicates what the paragraph will be about. Use signposting language to highlight key points and changes in direction or topic.
    

Here’s a revised version of a part of your text with these strategies applied:

“The initial stage of sugar production involves cultivating the **cane plants** over a period of **12 to 18 months**. Following this growth phase, the mature **stalks** are harvested, which can be done either manually by farmers or mechanically. **Subsequently**, the harvested **canes** are crushed to extract their sweet juice.”

By applying these techniques, you’ll enhance the coherence and cohesion of your writing, making it clearer and more engaging for the reader. Keep practicing, and you’ll see improvement over time. Good luck with your IELTS preparation!



task  2 : 

**

Advertising has always been about promoting your company's product over your competitor , so to create a good ad your company should have slogans about their product. One of the most common slogans nowadays is about how the company product is newer than their   competitors. To me this is a negative development because it often leads to misconception and fake advertising .   

  

In today's competitive society businesses need to constantly promote their product. So one of the most common strategies is to say if the product is newer than their competitor , this leads to more people hopping on and buying the product because they want to stay on trend or buying upgraded products , making the businesses have an edge over their competitors. But this also have a risk of it own. 

  

The new product is not actually that new and improved, maybe the business only upgraded some features like a better camera lens or a better sound quality . An example of this is the Iphone , we can see that after the Iphone 10 there have not been any more innovation that are impactful 

The Iphone is still the same old device it has always been but with some added little features , consequently making people buy products that they think have a greater quality then it really does. On the other  hand , New is not always better, an example of this  is  the Samsung phone where they remove the headphone plug , so as to force the user to use headphones with bluetooth or charger plug in only. 

  

So in conclusion, businesses should not focus on plumping out new product all the time but instead improve and maintain their existing product , create a better advertisement around their existing product so that it can be improve on more

The plans depict the transformation of an airport from its current state to its projected state after redevelopment next year. The most striking change is the completion of the airport with additional structures in both the departures and arrivals sections. Furthermore, there is a noticeable expansion of the northern corridor of the airport.

In the departures area, the current layout comprises two buildings: the Check-in and the Cafe. Post-development, an additional structure, the Bag Drop, enhances the functionality of this section. Similarly, the arrivals section undergoes a significant transformation. From a section with no buildings, it evolves into a well-equipped area housing a Cafe, Car Hire, and an ATM.

The northern corridor also witnesses substantial modifications. A shop has been added at the beginning of the corridor, and the existing walkway has been replaced with a Sky Train, facilitating easier transportation.

In summary, the redevelopment plan for the airport involves the addition of several new buildings in the departures and arrivals sections and the introduction of a Sky Train in the northern corridor

**Feedback:**

1. **Introduction:** Your introduction is clear and concise, providing a good overview of what the graph represents.
    
2. **Overview:** You’ve provided a good general overview of the trends. However, try to include more key features in your overview. For example, you could mention the highest and lowest points for both shop closures and openings.
    
3. **Details:** You’ve provided a good amount of detail in your description, but there are a few areas where you could be more precise. For instance, instead of saying “a nose drive from its peak with 9000 in 2011 to less than half in 2012”, you could say “a sharp decline from 9000 in 2011 to just over 4000 in 2012”.
    
4. **Grammar and Vocabulary:** There are a few grammatical errors and awkward phrases in your response. For example, “the rate of closing have fluctuated” should be “the rate of closing has fluctuated”. Also, “nose drive” is not a common phrase in English; consider using “sharp decline” or “steep drop” instead.
    
5. **Coherence and Cohesion:** Your response is generally well-organized and easy to follow. However, you could improve your use of linking words and phrases to make your writing more cohesive. For example, instead of starting a sentence with “In comparison to”, you could use “Compared to” or “In contrast to”.

## Task  1 : 
**The diagram illustrated the circular process for plastic bottles recycling 

Overall , we can see that there are 9 total processes . The process is first started by a plastic bottle user throwing always their plastic bottles to the end recycler product produced by the recycler bottles 

In the first stage , we can see the user throwing aways their plastic bottle in a recycling trash can . In the second stage when the time comes , the garbage collector collects the throwable plastic bottles then moves them to a recycling center in the third stage. In the third stage the recycling will then sort the plastic bases on which one is of the correct type , if the items are not of type plastic bottles the items are then put into a separate bin. In the fourth stage the plastic is then compress in to a cube for easier processing 

In the fifth stage, the plastic cube will be crushed into a little tiny bit which will then be soaked in water for washing. The bit will then be compressed and crushed into pellets in the six stages. These pellets will undergo a heating process  in the seven stages . These heated pellets will then be transformed into raw material in the eight stage , which will then be alter and used to produce end product in the nine stage

Thank you for sharing your solution. Based on the image description and your response, here’s my evaluation:

Your solution does a good job of describing the process of recycling plastic bottles. You have correctly identified the main stages and provided a clear sequence of events. However, there are a few areas where your solution could be improved:

1. **Grammar and Spelling**: There are some grammatical errors and spelling mistakes in your solution. For example, “throwing always” should be “throwing away”, and “plastic bases” should be “plastic based”. Paying attention to these details can significantly improve the clarity of your writing.
    
2. **Technical Accuracy**: Some terms could be used more accurately. For instance, instead of saying “plastic cube,” it would be more precise to say “compressed plastic”.
    
3. **Completeness**: Your solution does not mention that non-plastic items are discarded during the sorting stage. Including this detail would make your description more complete.
    
4. **Sentence Structure**: Your solution could benefit from more varied sentence structures. This can make your writing more engaging and easier to read.
    

Considering these factors, I would give your solution a score of **70 out of 100**. To improve your score, I recommend focusing on the areas mentioned above. Keep practicing and you’ll continue to improve! 😊


## task 2

Due to the continual development of technology , people have been predicting the arrival of  driverless trucks and buses. These transportation vehicles will only transport passengers with no driver inside , in my opinion this will be a negative development . 

  

There are some benefits to driverless vehicles ,these can include the ability to travel more easily due to the cost of traversal being lower and more vehicles being available because it will not have  the constraints of a limited human driver. However , In my opinion , the cost out weight the benefit.Firstly due to driverless car being more available to the public , more and more driver will be out of the jobs due to the increase competition , these driver usually do not have the best family background or education to find a more suitable job , consequently resulting in a mass of unemployed worker .

  

Secondly there is a low infrastructure to accommodate the driverless vehicle , these vehicles have to navigate to different changing terrain  and roads which can cause massive error in the system ,putting the passenger in danger  . An example of error due to an automatic system like this is chatgpt , chat gpt still creates mistakes and illusions due to the nature of its programming creating false answers and results. In academic setting this fine but if it is in a situation which involve people life it can be catastrophic 

  

In conclusion , driverless cars or self operating systems like this can cause damage to people's livelihood and should not be used to decide the fate or safety of human beings . It should be evaluated carefully so as to avoid mistake or careless implement in different sector

**Score: 75/100**

Your essay is well-structured and you’ve made some good points. However, there are areas where you can improve:

1. **Grammar and Vocabulary (20/25)**: There are a few grammatical errors and awkward phrases. For example, “the cost out weight the benefit” should be “the costs outweigh the benefits”. Also, try to use a wider range of vocabulary to express your ideas more effectively.
    
2. **Coherence and Cohesion (20/25)**: Your essay is logically organized and each paragraph has a clear main idea. However, some sentences could be more clearly connected to each other. For example, in the second paragraph, it would be clearer to say “However, in my opinion, the disadvantages outweigh the benefits. One major disadvantage is that…”
    
3. **Task Achievement (20/25)**: You have addressed the task and presented a clear position throughout the response. You could improve by providing more specific examples to support your points.
    
4. **Pronunciation (15/25)**: While this is a written essay, it’s important to write in a way that would be clear if spoken. Some sentences are a bit long and complex, which could make them difficult to pronounce in a spoken conversation. Try to keep your sentences concise and straightforward.
    

With the relentless advancement of technology, the advent of driverless trucks and buses is on the horizon. These vehicles, designed to transport passengers without a driver, are seen by some as a negative development. While I acknowledge the potential benefits, I firmly believe that the drawbacks are more significant.

Driverless vehicles do offer certain advantages. For instance, they could potentially reduce travel costs and increase the availability of vehicles, as they are not constrained by the limitations of human drivers. However, in my view, these benefits are outweighed by the drawbacks.

Firstly, the widespread adoption of driverless vehicles could lead to job losses for drivers. Many of these individuals may not have the educational background or resources to secure alternative employment, potentially leading to a surge in unemployment.

Secondly, our current infrastructure may not be equipped to accommodate driverless vehicles. These vehicles need to navigate diverse terrains and road conditions, which could lead to system errors and jeopardize passenger safety. For instance, even sophisticated AI systems like chatbots can produce erroneous responses due to the inherent limitations of their programming. While such errors might be acceptable in an academic setting, they could have catastrophic consequences when human lives are at stake.

In conclusion, while driverless vehicles and other autonomous systems have their merits, their potential to harm people’s livelihoods and compromise safety cannot be overlooked. Therefore, any implementation of such technologies should be approached with caution and thorough evaluation.
