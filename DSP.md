Here are two books on embedded DSP for ARM architectures that I see recommended frequently:

- Digital Signal Processing Using the ARM Cortex M4 by Donald S. Reay
    
- The Definitive Guide to ARM® Cortex®-M3 and Cortex®-M4 Processors by Joseph Yiu (Chapters 21 and 22 specifically; written by Paul Beckmann)
    

Personally, I learned a lot from Chapter 21 of Yiu's book. It goes into how you can optimize for the M4's instruction set
