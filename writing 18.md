the graph showcases insights about the percentage of city inhabitant in four different country between the years 1970 and 2022, with additional forecast for 2030 and 2040 
Overall, we can see an upward trend with more people moving to city , 
due to the effect of urbanization 
from  1970 to  2040  
We can see that all country have a steady growth of urbanization excluding the Philippines which has a peak in the year 1980 to 2010 . The urbanization rate on the other hand , have switch rank by each years with one country developing faster than another , we can see this with Malaysia overtaking the Philippines from 1980 to 2000 and Indonesia over taking both Thailand and Philippines from the 2000 onward 
In conclusion , we can see that urbanization rate for each developing country have continue to grow thought out the years ,  with some country  overtaking the other 



Task 2 : 

agree and disagree  
type of question : 
introduction 
- agree 
- science should be there improve life of people 
- there are other to say science should instead serve the government  interest 
first body  

- the government need science to create defend or weapon that do not improve people life but endanger them  
- these  weapon are used to defense or take resources from other nation and people can cause conflict
- but for the most part science discovery was create on the basic of improving on the life of people 
second paragraph 
- we can see that are quality of life is better with science each day , do to continues discovery  people are healthier then they were a century ago 
- people also have more time then they used to before due to discovery like the washing machine 
- like the most basic science discovery the wheel 
- the wheel was discover to make transportation better 

conclusion 
- In conclusion even thought some scientific discovery was made to endanger or cause harm to people for the most part science is about improving the quality and livelihood of humanity aiming for a better future 




I agree with the statement  that the main  purpose of science is the improvement of people's live 
Science discovery due have some negative downside which can cause more harm than good , an example of this is the atomic boom . the atomic boom was create for causing harm and destruction with the sole purpose of hurting people create by a new scientific discovery. But this for the most part science discovery and innovation was created on the basic of improving people life 
In addition, we can see people quality of life have improve drastically when compare to century ago due to the continua improvement of technology and science like medicine for example . For instance , the discovery of medical science have improve the health of many people , therefor causing people to live heathier life and live longer . Above all , disease which were life ending in the pass are now curable due to the continual improvement of science 
So in conclusion , even if some scientific discovery have cause harm and danger to human life , but for the most part science have continue to improve the quality of life for a large percentage of people with most scientific discovery continue to follow this trend  



# Part 2
## Task 1 


The chart illustrates the average income of household in 2007 , 2011 and 2015 
Overall , we can see that the number of households with an income bellow  74,999 risen in the year 2011 and decrease in the year 2015 , while the opposite is true for households with 75,000 or more decreasing in the year 2011 and risen in the year 2015
In the first year 2007 we can see the households with a 75000-99999 income have the lowest number while the households with 100000 income or more have the highest . In the next year 2011, a shift have happen with the second lowest income households containing the largest number overtaking the highest income households and the lowest number household still belong to household with a 75000-99999 income range . In the final year 2015 , the household number have reverted to their previous ranking in the 2007 with households with income of 100000 or more remaining on top and households with income ranging from 75000 to 99999 remain at the bottom
In conclusion , the ranking of households only have a significant change from the year 2007 to 2011 and 2011 to 2015 . On the other hand ,  number of households by annual income ranking  in the two years 2007 and 2015 remain the same 

body 1 : 
- today studying have become very competitive 
- collage degree continue to be a requirement instead of a advantage 
- so student are looking for more way to add to their academic and skill set 
- these skill make them more attractive to recruiter when they graduate 
- but they also have additional down side 
body 2 : 
- the specialty  when they enter collage their 
- if they do not focus on achiving high grade in collage they will be at a disadvantage 
- recruiter look for specialize student more than jack of all trade kind of student 
- this is much more prevalent in STEAM job where the application much dedicate them self in learning a specific trade 
- if they focus on other major or skill that do not contribute or contribute little to their main focus then they will take the risk of not having a solid foundation  
- mental health of student is also an importance factor the mind need time to rest before consuming additional subject so if student pursue many subject same time cause to over load 



Task  2   
In today modern age ,  dedicating yourself to normal course work in order to   graduate from a university will not guarantee you a job . There for , student are now studying more subject then their main one , in order  to increase their hiring chances . Some people disagree with this choice thinking they should focus all their energy on their main course . In my opinion student should focus on their main course at not to differ from their specialty  and overload their mind on studying 
Firstly , getting a job now day have become very competitive ,so the need to always upskill yourself  in order to outpace the competition will always be an admirable effort . As a result , the need to learn and understand a second subject so that student can have additional skill set and choices is very beneficial . 
However , the need for specialization out weight the need for diversify in all most any job , if the student manage to be the best at what they are doing and focus on one specific trade , then   they will never worry about job competition because recruiter look for specialize student . In addition , for degree like STEM and medicine  you should only pursue the course subject in order not to burn out or cause more mental health damage due to the difficulty and dedication of these major . An example of a successful specialize student who only focus on their major is a PHD student , PHD student exceed in their flied of study earning them both reputation and admiration from everyone 
So in conclusion , even thought it is good for student to diversify their skill set in order to have an advantage in the work force . Student should focus more on their main major and subject so as to have a highly value profession
