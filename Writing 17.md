## task  2
In our modern age , where our choices have grown to an exponential level ,creating more opportunity . Due to the growing number of choices people have been taking more risk in both their professional and personal lives to have a greater reward . This is an advantage in my opinion because people are now able to take more risk in pursuit of a better life 

When people say the word risk , all negative thoughts will  come spiraling into their head about danger and negativity associated with them . But it does not have to be this way ,risks are  tests of bravery , accepting a risk is equivalent to accepting a challenge , a challenge that will enable growth for the future. The people who partake in these risk will most likely gamble on a better future with more opportunity continually growing and changing to be better then they were before 

Risks enable a person to experience a new horizon, from their own safety bubble enabling them to understand themselves and their choices more clearly . An example of this is job hopping , job hopping enables hoppers to have more money when they are transitioning from their old and new working environment but this will come with its own set of risks, risks like will they fit into the company culture and can they adapt to their new job environment.... These risk 

may seem like alot , but if the reward and experience we gain from it out way the negative then it is understandable why people would choose to take such risks

So in conclusion , risks can be dangerous to take  but if we smartly weight out the  advantage and disadvantage combine with our own skill and ability we can safely take  them with minimum risks in the pursuit of a better life and our own development
