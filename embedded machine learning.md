In the US, entry level ML starts much lower, then after a few years skyrockets. Then embedded usually starts at a standard rate comparable to other SWEs but moves up much slower. Because embedded involves hardware you are simply further away from the money, as any company that needs an embedded engineer has a lot of other overhead. Embedded is also a difficult field so it takes a long time to get good at (depending on what you are doing). I am an embedded engineer moving to ML for this reason. I had a lot of experience in computer vision and was hired to do computer vision, my company restructured and moved me to embedded work. I am the only SWE and it is kind of a nightmare tbh. It is very hard to get ML jobs without experience which is why they low ball entry level positions. It is also very hard to get people to do entry level embedded jobs which is why they pay well, as most software engineers want to go into a higher paying field. That being said, embedded systems engineers, which design both hardware and software, make more than SWEs. So there is plenty of opportunity in embedded, it is just much smaller as a field in the US. I don't know what to tell you, I am basically in a similar position. Do I keep my embedded job and wait a few years to make more money, or try to switch to ML which only low balls entry level positions. I don't know lol. I would say do ML if you can, it will only grow in need. But embedded will expand greatly in India as well, and if you can retain your skills as an EE you can make just as much as ML if you design both. If you do side projects and keep learning you can always transition to ML after embedded. That is exactly what I am doing.
