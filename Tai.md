From the posters in your image, here are the K-pop groups I can identify:

1. **NewJeans** – Multiple posters feature NewJeans members, including a large one of **Haerin** in the center.
    
2. **Stray Kids** – The poster in the upper left corner labeled **"BORN TO BE"** is from Stray Kids.
    
3. **IVE** – The group photo in pink outfits on the left wall is from IVE.
    
4. **SEVENTEEN** – The colorful group poster on the left wall looks like SEVENTEEN.
    
5. **LE SSERAFIM** – The black-and-white poster of five women in the lower middle part is from LE SSERAFIM.
    
6. **BLACKPINK** – Some of the individual black-and-white photos (like the bottom ones) appear to be of BLACKPINK members.
    

Let me know if you want help identifying specific individuals or need suggestions for decorating your K-pop wall more!

From this second image, here are the K-pop groups I can identify:

1. **NewJeans** – Clearly featured multiple times:
    
    - The albums and posters with the blue design and the member Haerin's face (bottom center and right).
        
    - The distinctive logo style and visuals match NewJeans’ aesthetic.
        
2. **Stray Kids** – The "2nd Mini Album" poster on the left wall appears to be from **Stray Kids**' _I am WHO_ or _I am NOT_ era, based on the grungy style and font.
    

If you’d like, I can help you catalog all the albums and merch in your collection or suggest more posters to go with your current theme!


From this third image, here are the K-pop groups I can identify:

1. **NewJeans** – Clearly featured again:
    
    - The large purple-pink poster at the top left ("CALL ME HAERIN / HYPE BOY") is themed around Haerin from NewJeans.
        
    - The repeated "NEWJEANS" text confirms it.
        
2. **IVE** – The light purple-toned poster in the middle (with members in white and gray) is from **IVE**.
    
    - The outfits and pose match one of their promo photoshoots.
        
3. **LE SSERAFIM** – The poster on the left side with four women, and the one near the bottom middle, both feature members of **LE SSERAFIM**.
    
4. **TWICE** – The small photo-card style images along the bottom (particularly the image of a member in a red outfit and another in white) appear to be **TWICE** members, though not all are perfectly visible.
    

If you'd like, I can help you make a visual checklist of all the groups represented across your posters!
