computer systems, computer and communications networks, software,  
computerized data, content transferred by computer, traffic and control data  and the users of all of the above.
## An Entirely Human Creation and a Substrate
#cyber_realm  is an  entirely human creation  , mean that it is not a naturally occurred realm that military have to operate

#cyber_realm  is not just a new domain, but a substrate, an  
underlying layer that is crucial to every facet of modern life: political,  
social, economic, cultural and military.

## Challenges to the Concept of Statehood 
 less control over their cyber borders than   physical ones 
 Most cyber attacks take place against individuals and public  
and private organizations, only they can bear ultimate responsibility for their defense, not their governments

## Changes to the Nature of Warfare 
cyber power is not primarily about the size and quality of a stateâ€™s armed  
forces
Cyber attacks are much cheaper than conventional or  
unconventional ones and can be carried out by comparatively small  
numbers of people
Many of the most important targets in the cyber realm  
are not military
organizational information systems, are often the new  
battlefields and as such must be the focus of any cyber security strategy
