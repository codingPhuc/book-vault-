Quant has become a pretty broad term. They work all across finance in different type of roles. At one end of the spectrum you have quant researchers at successful hedge funds. This fits your description. Likely a PhD in math or a related field, probably did well in math competitions, and did some interesting research. There aren't a lot of these roles, and the compensation can be ridiculous.

## what do they do ?  
A quantitative analyst’s main task is to present a given hypothetical situation in terms of numerical values. Quantitative analysis helps in evaluating performance, assessing financial instruments, and making predictions. It encompasses three main techniques of measuring data: [regression analysis](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/data-science/regression-analysis/), linear programming, and data mining.

- Developing and implementing mathematical models to help forecast financial markets and identify investment opportunities
- Analyzing financial data to identify trends and patterns
- Building and testing financial trading algorithms
- Designing and implementing risk management strategies
- Collaborating with other professionals, such as traders and portfolio managers, to make investment decisions

At the other end you have quant-developers. Likely a CS/eng/math background, maybe a masters, and with great programming skills. Instead of doing research, they are implementing ideas in code. And there is a whole range in between.

Most of the statistics related work is on the buy-side. Meaning you work for some sort of investment firm, and your job is to look at data and try to find patterns/market inefficiencies. And again there is a large spectrum. You could work in high frequency trading and be concerned with millions of trades a second, or you could work on the global-macro level and make a few dozen trades a year.
