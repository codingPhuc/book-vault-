Most colleges and employers see the GED and a high school diploma as the same. Just under 100% of U.S. schools accept the GED, including community colleges, private secondary or technical institutes, and universities.

Coupling your GED with a decent ACT or SAT score will improve your chances of getting accepted into a top school. Or, you can bypass other standardized tests with a GED College-Ready score, awarded to those who earn a high score on their GED tests.

Because the GED is equivalent to a high school diploma, in addition to using it to register for college, you can also use it to apply for a job.

Many employers view these achievements equally when it comes to a GED vs. a high school diploma, and getting a GED can lead to a higher salary. Many GED graduates can make [around $8,500 more annually](https://ged.com/insession/postsecondary-credentials_oct2018/) than those without a GED or diploma.

Yeah! There’s so many free online videos/dedicated channels on the GED test on YouTube that can help you out. I passed every other test without studying except for math, which I just used GetSumMath (got a 164). I’ve been out of school for a little bit and it wasn’t as bad as I thought, just study on the ones you don’t think you’re that confident in a month/couple weeks prior and you should be good!

For other subjects there should be channels/youtube videos for them as well, just posting the only one I used :)
