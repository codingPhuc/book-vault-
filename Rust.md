Rust is a high  level  programing  language   , for  operating system  programming modul ,  infrastuture applicaiton  ,  distributed software system  aerospace and defense application . 
C  and C++  programming language is good for   developing defense 

# Rust 
rust is carefully designed  to evolve   improve   without abruptly obsoleting   previously  developed  
want to install rust tool  chain on one desktop  computer  visit   a lot of software that are available  on the web   
all the support library  is though  crates 
rust is a functional  programming language   , does have procedural  programming  .  Main benefit is type saft analyzing the code though   language  it can detect  situation  to why your program is unsafe here are suggestion on how to change it   



##  Overview of the Rust language  
The cargo  tool  provides an integrated unite  test  facility  , and rustc  has a   powerfull macro code generation  capability  
standard library   
what is a  rust  macro ?  
relationship  between  various component of the tool chain  

embedded  development cross development   
doing  thing that are not supported  on a system 
Rust  target span a wide range of hardware platforms : 
 arm32/64   ,   x86-64  

for the full target list  
C++  code just run   doing something in  a loop ,  thing will blow  up  ,  you pointer that  point of to  garbage  value  

Rust  low level  programming   embedded RAW  MEMORY  address  ,   DMA controller    
rust allow them to be used in  unsafe  keyword  provides  this ability   .  Permit memory  address  reference  operation with its  'raw  pointer  '  feature  


## Overview of the Rust language    continue 
rust does not have  garbage collection   , nor does the programmer free  up  unused  variable  
rust  used   either static  , stack or  heap  allocated  memory  
LLVM   model compiler used to  get out of the block  compiler support  binary  single file that run them  insulation 


## Rust data structure  
Thread  the allocator ,  certain other useful Rust feature are provided  by its  standard library   .  This help reduce   compiler complexity 
Rust heap  allocated resizable    arrays are provided   via the generic  std::Vec<t> type
