# subject verb error 
This type of error is called a **subject-verb agreement error**. The subject ("industrial area") is singular, so the verb should also be in its singular form ("has" instead of "have"). Additionally, "changed" is in the passive voice, so the past participle form ("has been changed") is required rather than the base verb ("have been change"). 


This is also a **subject-verb agreement error**. The subject ("map") is singular, so the verb should match by using the singular form "showcases" instead of "showcase."

**"is showcase"** should be **"is showcased"** (subject-verb agreement). This is cause by a passive voice , meaning the information is being shown by something else 

"the budget for the police force have increase" should be "the budget for the police force has increased" (subject-verb agreement).In this 'has'  is  used to showcases that the budget is a none singular form and increase should be increased due to the information have already been shown  



## incorrect punctuation  
**having the highest increase of 11 million follow by"** should be **"having the highest increase of 11 million, followed by"** (correct verb form).

## incorrect uses  

"taking up the majority in spending in both year second by building and transport and technology being third" should be "taking up the majority of spending in both years, followed by building and transport, with

technology third" (clarifies ordering and corrects “second” and “year”).
"from the year 2017 to 2018" should be "from 2017 to 2018" (unnecessary use of “the year”).

"spending from 2017 and 2018 have had" should be "spending from 2017 to 2018 has had" (subject-verb agreement and correct “from…to” phrasing). 
- spending is singular so it should be has instead of have 
- the correct phase should be from-to  
- spending has had for correct subject verb  

**"increase spending"** should be **"increased spending"** (correct form).
- here increase is verb , but spending have already increase so increase should be a past like increased 

Corrected "on their phone" to "on their phones" for consistency.   
- their should be many so phone much have an s at the end 

**Grammar**: Changed "the children's spend" to "children spend" for correct grammatical structure.
- children should be  getting grid of the 's due to the fact that they do not belong to anything or anyone 

**Word Choice**: Changed "using phone" to "using phones" for grammatical consistency.
- you are referencing to many children so the correct used should have an s at the end of phone 
# repetition  

Adjusted the final sentence for clarity and fluidity, replacing "to lure or kidnap the children" with "to lure or kidnap them" to avoid repetition.
