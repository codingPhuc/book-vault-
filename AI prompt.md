# promt for video sumarization 
Could you please summarize the main ideas of the first 10 minutes of this video transcript and split it into sections with bullet points? Each section should include a timestamp for when the video is discussing that topic. For each section, please provide a summary in bullet points. The number of sections and bullet points is not limited and should correspond to the content of the video.

Here’s the structure I’d like you to follow:  
• Section 1 (Timestamp: t_1 : t_2 (t_1<t_2)):  
o Bullet point 1: Brief summary of the introduction  
o Bullet point 2: Key takeaway from the introduction  
o Continue to add bullet points as necessary to fully summarize this section

Repeat the above structure for each section of the video, creating as many sections and bullet points as needed to provide a comprehensive summary.

Please ensure that the summary for each section is as accurate as possible up to the end timestamp (t_2) for that section. If the discussion on a topic continues beyond the end timestamp, please do not truncate the information. Instead, continue the summary in the next section, starting from the new timestamp
