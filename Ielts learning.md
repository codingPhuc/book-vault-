## 2. Create a study schedule

Discipline is the key to any successful study schedule. It can be all too easy to postpone study if you’re busy with other tasks, but creating a [study schedule](https://ielts.com.au/australia/prepare/prepare-for-ielts) that you can stick to is critical to making sure you’re prepared on test day.

Sit down on a Sunday and think about any gaps in your schedule for the next week where you could fit in some studying. If you find it difficult to set aside larger chunks of time, start with a few blocks of 10 or 15 minutes throughout your day that you can use as mini-study sessions.
