Degree cyber security  : 
- Studied on YouTube and Udemy for 6 months.
- Started at an entry-level help desk at an MSP.
- Spent another 12 months studying and working, then got promoted within the business.
- As a hiring manager, preference is given to those who self-studied and learned on the job.
- Many university graduates had a deep understanding of theory but lacked practical skills.
- Some graduates seemed entitled, thinking a degree guarantees a job.
- The focus in hiring is on finding individuals who stand out and make a difference.
- A self-starter and motivator who didn’t attend university but worked hard is more appealing.
- This approach is standard across the IT industry.
- Recommends checking out Sysadmin, Programmer, Software Engineer, DevOps, CyberSec subreddits for common practices.
- Suggests not bothering with university.
- Recommends breaking into the industry, gaining work experience, and then specializing from there.

- Started studying cyber security at TAFE, coming from a background in electrical and mechanical trades.
- Spent a few months watching CompTIA A+ and Network+ course material on the Professor Messer website to build a base in IT fundamentals.
- Listened to the same courses on Spotify by Third Leg Technology.
- Completed online quizzes for those courses to help retain the information.
- Listened to every episode of Darknet Diaries and Cybersecurity101 with Joe and Larry to understand what cyber security is.
- This preparation was enough to pass a test to get into the TAFE course and gave a head start on understanding the subject.

I've been interested in cybersec since i was 13 and got into networking to understand how things work but you don't really need that deeper of studies like I jumped into a fulltime course for Networking.

Note*: You don't need to be an expert in computers, a coder, or a networking person to be able to understand it. You just need to make sure that you understand basics or can learn them.

Duration: Depends on your pace, usually if you dedicate 4-5 months just taking a self-learning course and putting in even 10-20 hours per week you'll have a head start and have a better chance than most people.

After all my experience and trying multiple platforms, I recommend getting familiar with cybersec terms, the ways and how things are done usually found in courses of CompTIA Security+ cert. You can find courses for it online: [https://www.udemy.com/course/securityplus/](https://www.udemy.com/course/securityplus/)

It's also important to note that there are they have a nice beginner Ethical hacking course which provides you with basic networking courses and how to set everything up step by step. end (very good for beginners and makes you understand things better), Red teams ( pure attacking side to pentest), and Purple teams (mixture of both red and blue).

You could check out platforms like TryHackMe which has structured pathways for both Blue and red teamers - it has free content but better pay $10 per month to have access to labs and everything.

Tryhack me has like multiple paths:

1. Pre-security teaches you networking and security basics [https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/presecurity](https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/presecurity)
    
2. [https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/introtocyber](https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/introtocyber)
    
3. Complete beginner path even if you're not they have a nice beginner Ethical hacking course which provides you with bas - they can look good but better to get comfortable with Linux, commands, windows and technologies. [https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/beginner](https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/beginner)
    

TCM Security: [https://academy.tcm-sec.com/](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/) they have a nice beginner Ethical hacking course which provides you basic networking courses and how to set everything up step by step.

It's also important to note that there are multiple domains in cybersec and roles. Depends on what you are excited about and interested in. Like the Blue teaming side - defensive end (very good for beginners and makes you understand things better), Red teams ( pure attacking side to pentest), and Purple teams (mixture of both red and blue).lue).

Although you'll see fancy platforms like HackTheBox now they even have academy courses: [https://academy.hackthebox.com/](https://academy.hackthebox.com/) - they can look good but better to get comfortable with linux, commands, windows and technologies.

Sorry for typing too long. It can be frustrating to choose a platform/course when you're starting something new. I wrote - they can look good but better to get comfortable with Linux, commands, windows and technologies.

There are two entry-level pentester certifications after you do your CompTIA Sec+ (comptia sec+ is just market approved cert so do it to get your resume picked by a recruiter):

1. eJPT: [https://security.ine.com/certifications/ejpt-certification/](https://security.ine.com/certifications/ejpt-certification/)
    
2. PJPT- I recommend this [https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pjpt/](https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pjpt/)
    

I've been interested in cybersecurity since I was 13 and got into networking to understand how things work but you don't need that deeper of studies like I jumped into a full-time course for Networking.nd technologies. sume that will make your profile visible to recruiters hiring for tech support jobs and tell them that you know networking fundamentals and are more than able to troubleshoot basic windows or router/switch-based issues.

In Australia, employers seem to ask for a bachelors but to be honest, just try to aim for a certification not for the sake of a "certificate" but for the knowledge it provides you. I've done this my whole life. (PS: I'm only 23). I have college studies in networking and just certifications for everything right after that nothing much. That's how I show my work to employers... like side projects and all.

# Australia 

Ignore all the people here who say Australia is as expensive as Singapore. It is not. Singapore is more expensive for sure and I have lived in both.

Do the working holiday visa, and then try moving to a traineeship visa. The other way would be to do a masters and then get the post graduate visa.

Good luck. If you want serious advice get a migration consult. It cost me about $150 but it gave me 100% accurate advice.
