It sounds like you're looking for a mix of great customer service, a solid mobile app, and good loan options. Based on what you've said and what others have shared:

- **Chase** has a top-tier app but lacks in customer service.
- **US Bank** seems to offer great personalized service, which you value, but you'd need to check if their app meets your expectations.
- **Capital One** gets a lot of praise for its online experience, but has some quirks like limited account linking.
- **Credit Unions & Community Banks** tend to excel in service and loans but often lack the best apps.
- **Ally, Alliant, & Other Online Banks** offer high savings rates and solid apps but lack physical branches.
- **Schwab & Fidelity** are great if you want investment features along with banking.

If mobile banking is a top priority, Capital One or Ally could be worth looking into. If you’re after personal service, a credit union or community bank may be your best bet. Since you like US Bank’s in-person experience, testing their app before switching might be a good idea. Have you considered running a small test account with them first?

I think BofA is favored more by people in the latter part of their financial journey. When you’re younger and running paycheck to paycheck, their maintenance fees can add up quickly, driving someone away. When you get to a point where you’re more settled (have some resemblance of an emergency fund, you start investing, you start strategically using credit cards), then they become much more attractive.

They were my first bank at 18, lasted a couple years, then had a slight break for about 10yrs (I just wasn’t making enough money to keep up with them). When things started coming together and I wanted a more full service bank, and could afford it without paying fees for everything, I slowly, unconsiously transitioned back.

In my late 20’s after royally fucking up my credit, they were the first one to give me a shot. They said “we’ll give you a credit card with a $500 limit if you deposit $99”. And they were firm - until I cleaned up my act they would not budge on conversion or increases.

I still have that card today (it was ultimately converted and has a much higher limit today), plus a few others from them.

Now, my total cards is maxed ($99,900), have platinum honors, do my basic investing, a years emergency fund, and other emergency savings all at BofA.

You get additional discounts when guying a car or home thru them, but have not done those as I get much lower rates with Navy Federal - this is individual specific.

They’re good, and more so, to big to fail, but deep down I know that BofA is out to protect itself first so I never go head first with them, but rather just enough to be able to take advantage of the things they offer while making sure I don’t get hosed over in the process.

They are my “safety net” bank. I truly believe you’ll get different responses about BofA based on where someone is in their financial journey, but for me, after 23yrs, I’m nestled in cozy with ‘em.

They have tech quirks, but when the benefit you’re getting out of them outweighs the inconveniences, they become very minor very quickly.



Here’s a summary of the main issues and sentiments shared in the discussion about Bank of America (BoA):

---


The original poster shared their frustration as a new Bank of America credit card holder. They received a lower-than-expected credit limit, which didn’t cover the balance transfer they had planned. Within just two weeks, they experienced two customer service failures, where they were promised resolutions that never came. Now, they’re planning to stop using the card, pay off the balance, and possibly close the account—unless it involves a fee. They’re giving BoA one more chance before filing a formal complaint and cutting ties entirely.

Other users chimed in with similar stories. One person said BoA closed both their personal and joint accounts after a single returned check, even though it was the first time that had ever happened in four years. They were also concerned about how uncommunicative the bank was during the process. Another commenter mentioned that while BoA used to be decent, its technology now feels outdated compared to competitors like Chase.

One user described a nightmare scenario where it took six weeks to close a checking account because no one would answer the phone or assist over chat. They ended up driving an hour to a branch and waiting 30 minutes just to speak to someone. Another reported a serious security breach: someone in a different state accessed their online banking, and it took two months—plus a complaint to the Better Business Bureau—before they could access their funds again. They’ve since switched banks and described their new experience as “night and day” compared to BoA.

The overall sentiment in the thread is overwhelmingly negative, with recurring themes of poor customer service, account access issues, outdated systems, and a lack of transparency. Many users said they have either already switched banks or plan to soon..
