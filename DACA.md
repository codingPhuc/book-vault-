Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)  

On June 15, 2012, the Secretary of Homeland Security announced that certain people who came to the United States as children and meet several guidelines may request consideration of deferred action for a period of 2 years, subject to renewal. They are also eligible to request work authorization. Deferred action is an exercise of prosecutorial discretion to defer removal action against an individual for a certain period of time. Deferred action does not provide lawful status.

On Aug. 30, 2022, DHS published the DACA Final Rule, with the intent to preserve and fortify the DACA policy. This rule, which puts into effect regulations at 8 CFR 236.21-236.25, rescinds and replaces the DACA guidance set forth in the 2012 Memorandum issued by Secretary Napolitano.

I was a fifth year undocumented student in a UC. I believe they provide 5th year fin aid extension for students in STEM no question. For other majors they will probably ask but it’s best to ask the financial aid officer in a UC about it. They’ll understand. But if you’re a transfer in a UC, your 5th year will be considered as a 3rd year
