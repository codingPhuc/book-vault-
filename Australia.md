# Australia  

Ignore all the people here who say Australia is as expensive as Singapore. It is not. Singapore is more expensive for sure and I have lived in both.

Do the working holiday visa, and then try moving to a traineeship visa. The other way would be to do a masters and then get the post graduate visa.

Good luck. If you want serious advice get a migration consult. It cost me about $150 but it gave me 100% accurate advice.

Starting from March 23, Australia will implement stricter visa regulations for international students. This decision was made in response to a record high level of immigration, which has exacerbated the already strained rental housing market in Australia.

From March 23, the English proficiency requirements for visas for undergraduate students, postgraduate students, and researchers will be increased. The Australian government will also have the authority to suspend the recruitment of international students by educational institutions if they continuously violate recruitment rules.

These measures, which will reduce immigration density, are part of a “real test” for international students, as Australia continues to crack down on students who come to Australia just to find work.

In addition, Australian officials will apply requirements not to stay beyond the visa period to more tourist visas. This move follows a series of actions to end the relaxations that were put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2022, Australia increased its annual immigration quota to help businesses recruit enough staff, compensating for the post-pandemic labor shortage. However, the sudden influx of foreign workers and students has put additional pressure on Australia’s already strained rental housing market.
