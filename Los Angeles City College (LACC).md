The Federal Work-Study Program (FWS) enables students to earn a portion of their financial aid award through part time employment either on or off campus. To be eligible, a student must meet the eligibility requirements for federal financial aid and must maintain good academic standing while employed under the program. A minimum enrollment level may be required for FWS eligibility. You must meet eligibility standards to work within the LACCD. Check with your college's Financial Aid Office.
