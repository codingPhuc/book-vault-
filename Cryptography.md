Hereâ€™s a summary of the information discussed:

- **Cryptography vs. Cryptanalysis**:
    
    - **Cryptography**: Creation of new encryption algorithms, typically more artistic.
    - **Cryptanalysis**: Breaking/deciphering existing cryptography, considered more scientific.
- **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography**:
    
    - Focus on developing algorithms that are resistant to quantum computing threats, not relying on traditional techniques like discrete logarithms or prime factorization.
- **Career Paths**:
    
    - **Government**: Opportunities involve cryptographic algorithm research, breaking existing ciphers, often involving intelligence agencies (e.g., NSA).
    - **Academia**: Research-focused, typically requires a PhD in mathematics or cryptography. Vital for designing new cryptographic systems.
    - **Private Companies**: Roles in software libraries, implementing encryption algorithms (e.g., OpenSSL), security research, or working at companies like Crowdstrike, MITRE, or tech firms like Google.
- **Private Sector Cryptography**:
    
    - Jobs at **companies** (e.g., banks, VPN providers, certificate authorities) where cryptography is used for securing communications, data storage, and more.
    - **Crypto exchanges** and companies developing cutting-edge crypto-tech (e.g., blockchain companies, financial tech firms).
- **Cryptography Engineers**:
    
    - **Role**: Design, implement, and maintain cryptographic systems or solutions.
    - **Difficult to Become**: Typically requires strong mathematical knowledge, but some positions may involve implementing existing algorithms rather than creating new ones.
- **Educational Path**:
    
    - Strong mathematical foundation is essential. Most cryptographic designers are mathematicians with advanced degrees (PhD).
    - **For undergraduates**: Start with a computer science background, focus on learning cryptography principles, and later transition to specialized roles.
- **Pay**:
    
    - **Cryptographer Salaries**: Typically high, with experienced professionals earning over $100K/year, depending on the role.
    - **Developer/Tech Side**: Requires programming and networking knowledge, with salaries often in the **FAANG** range (large tech companies).
- **Job Types**:
    
    - **Cryptography Developer**: Writing code that implements cryptographic algorithms. Involves working with libraries, understanding standards (e.g., TLS, encryption), and ensuring the security of implementations.
    - **Vulnerability Researcher**: Identifying flaws in cryptographic algorithms and systems.
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**:
    
    - **Emerging Field**: Knowledge of quantum-resistant encryption is increasingly sought after as quantum computing progresses.
- **Certifications & Skills**:
    
    - Certain certifications (e.g., related to HSMs, VPNs, secure communications) can help in entering the field of cryptography.
    - Multilingual coding (e.g., Java, C++) and knowledge of cryptographic standards are critical for success in cryptography roles.
- **Work Environments**:
    
    - Government agencies, large tech companies, financial institutions, cybersecurity firms, and consulting roles often require cryptography expertise.
