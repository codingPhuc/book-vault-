is any premeditated malicious activity designed to  disrupt a computer or network, or to collect, disrupt, deny, degrade, take  
over, or destroy information systems or the information itself.5 Malware,  
malicious code, and cyber exploits, frequently used interchangeably, are  
the means by which cyber attacks are carried out, that is, computer code  
designed to give the attacker access to a targeted system or damage it. They  
include viruses (malicious code that activates when a file is opened),  
worms (malicious code that spreads without having to open files), Trojan  
horses (malicious code that appears useful but is designed to modify the  
system or allow remote control of it), and ransomware (in which a ransom  
is demanded as the price of unencrypting a system taken over by the  
attacker)
## Immediacy
Cyber attacks happen instantaneously, with the stroke of a key  
on a computer
code once developed for a given target system and not all stages of  
cyber attacks

cyber attacks
## Super Empowerment 
The “big data” capabilities that were once the  sole province of governments
well-funded nonstate actor, and may achieve unprecedented  
affects. ISIS and other terrorist organizations have put cyber capabilities to  
extensive and effective use.
## No Geographic Limits
unlike all other weapons systems,   conventional or unconventional, cyber weapons have no geographic  limitations and ignore national borders. 

can be launched   concomitantly around the globe
## Systemic Disruption and Even Destruction 
ber attacks have the  
potential to cause disruption on a heretofore unprecedented systemic scale
other weapons are localized, even nuclear  weapons, 
 A nationwide, or even  regional, disruption of an adversary’s electric grid could cause social economic havoc 

## Lethal and Non-Lethal Uses 
Cyber weapons usually do  not have lethal effect,
but the  cyber realm, they maintain, does not fundamentally change military or  foreign affairs, and the dangers are overstated

## Cyber Is Similar to Long-Standing Asymmetric 
like cyber ones, have become  global, with major terrorist organizations operating around the world and  leaving defenders in both areas with an enormous number


## Cyber Capabilities Are Difficult and Expensive 
creating effective cyber weapons and defenses requires highly  
developed technical capabilities, 
advanced R&D teams, the ability to test  
the weapons developed, and more. Actors also need effective intelligence  
capabilities to gain highly detailed information about the target

## Super Empowerment, but for Advanced Actors 
the resources and knowhow  needed to successfully conduct sophisticated attacks are beyond the capabilities of all but a handful of advanced nonstate actors 

## Cyberspace Is Not a Lawless Wild West 
cyber does pose new problems  of attribution, but this is not fundamentally different from chemical and  biological weapons
