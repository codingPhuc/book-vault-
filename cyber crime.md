# Cyber Attack 
Cyber attacks threaten the national security of state in various way : economic, military, political, diplomatic, cultural, and criminal. 

not yet definitively known to have caused fatalities, but they  
have caused damage to physical facilities

The lethal effects of cyber  
weapons would be slower, but possibly nation-wide and beyond,

for a Cyber Attack to succeed,  attackers must be capable of developing unique capabilities tailored to the   specific target system ,It also usually requires the ability to put together multiple  complex teams with different professional skill sets 
## effect of cyber attack  
sophisticated and determined attacker with adequate resources could  
cause severe and potentially even devastating systemic damage

Cyber  attacks could wreak havoc on civil infrastructure systems essential to dayto-day life, such as electricity, water, communication and transportation
Cyber  attacks could disrupt or take control of monitoring systems at power plants,  nuclear reactors

Anyone with a computer can now pose a potential threat. Attackers can  
hack private computers and launch an attack without the owner’s  
knowledge

They can link individual computers to a broader network  
(known as a botnet or zombie army) originating from a nearly endless  
number of sources. Moreover, the increasing interdependency of networks  
means that a successful attack on one has the potential to cause even greater  damage by harming all systems connected to it

The United States was deeply concerned that 700 million smartphones  
made by Huawei and ZTE, for example, two of China’s largest  
manufacturers, had software implanted in them that would enable the  
Chinese military to spy on users’ movements and communications.
