The conversation you're referencing sheds light on the realities of pursuing a career in Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and highlights some important considerations regarding skills, job titles, and qualifications.

1. **DSP as a Secondary Skill**: Many job opportunities where DSP is involved tend to be in roles where DSP is part of a broader skillset, such as Embedded Software Development, Software Engineering, or FPGA Design. In these positions, DSP knowledge is required, but the primary focus is usually on system implementation, modeling, or hardware. MATLAB, Simulink, Python, and FPGA skills are often essential.
    
2. **Job Titles and Demand**: It's true that DSP-focused job titles are rare, especially those specifically labeled as "DSP Engineer." When such titles do appear, they are often tied to specialized roles in industries like defense, communications, or research. These positions often demand advanced degrees (such as a master's or Ph.D.), reflecting the deep expertise required. For most jobs involving DSP, itâ€™s likely that candidates with strong programming or hardware design skills will be considered, even if DSP is only one aspect of the job.
    
3. **Advanced Degrees**: A graduate degree can be important for those aiming for more research-heavy DSP roles or algorithm design positions. However, in many applied DSP jobs, especially those related to system design or embedded systems, a Ph.D. is not typically required, and hands-on experience with DSP tools and hardware implementation is more important.
    
4. **Industry Applications**: DSP skills are in demand in a variety of sectors, including medical instrumentation, telecommunications (e.g., 4G/5G), audio processing, image processing, and control systems. These industries often look for candidates with a mix of theoretical knowledge and practical implementation skills.
    
5. **Job Search and Opportunities**: Certain geographic regions, like Virginia, Maryland, and the DC area, are hotspots for DSP jobs, especially in defense and government contracting. Tools like Indeed can be helpful for finding DSP-related job postings.
    

For newcomers to DSP, the best approach is often to build a strong foundation in both theory (signal processing concepts) and practical skills (MATLAB, Python, FPGA, etc.), and to be open to related fields like embedded systems or software engineering. Specializing in DSP might be more feasible through these broader roles rather than looking for purely DSP-focused positions.
