### Essential Skills for Data Science and Related Roles

#### **Core Skills:**

- **Math Fundamentals:**
    - Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability, and Statistics.
    - Understanding and interpreting proofs.
- **Programming:**
    - Python or any OOP language (focus on data structures and algorithms).
    - SQL proficiency for data querying.
- **Communication:**
    - Explaining technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.
    - Effective visual communication and information design.
- **Networking:**
    - Building professional relationships.

#### **Tools and Concepts to Learn:**

- **Development & Deployment:**
    - Virtual environments, Docker, Kubernetes.
    - CI/CD pipelines and GitHub.
    - Cloud Platforms (e.g., AWS).
- **Workflow Management:**
    - Airflow and MLFlow for workflow orchestration and model tracking.
- **Dashboarding:**
    - Familiarity with tools like Tableau or Looker.

#### **Learning Approach:**

- **Beginner Advice:**
    - Start with interview preparation (LeetCode for data structures & algorithms).
    - Learn MLOps concepts (but deep dive on the job).
    - Focus on business problem-solving in real projects.
- **Debugging:**
    - Mastering debuggers to transition from notebooks to scripts.

#### **Specialized Advice for Aspiring Data Scientists:**

- **Early Career:**
    - Broader knowledge across various tools and techniques.
    - Time series understanding for future benefit.
- **Switching Roles:**
    - Awareness of MLOps helps with transitions to Machine Learning Engineer (MLE) or Data Engineer (DE).

#### **Diploma Decision Guidance:**

- **Option 1 (Broad Focus):**
    - Covers Python, SQL, Machine Learning, NLP, and basic time series.
    - Recommended for general data science roles.
- **Option 2 (Time Series Focus):**
    - In-depth statistics and time series analysis.
    - Suitable for banking/finance-focused roles, but broader knowledge is better for early career growth.

#### **Other Recommendations:**

- **Join or Create a CompSci Club:**
    - Build web/mobile applications.
    - Gain real-world experience and potential income through monetization.
- **Practical Application Focus:**
    - Avoid letting models stay in notebooksâ€”deploy them in real environments.
