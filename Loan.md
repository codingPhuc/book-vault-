Scholarship options for Masters are a lot if you look at the right school websites. Country-specific scholarships and scholarships like the Common wealth that are international are also common. In short, she should dedicate at least 2 weeks to explore scholarships (it's tedious work and the information isn't commonly found) but there are a lot of scholarships open to Masters especially in STEM programs.

I wouldn't technically advice anyone to go for a loan from these companies if they don't have at least 50% of tuition covered by some other means. It could mess you up on the long track.

Other than that, you both seem to be thinking about this the right way. Do not be afraid of skipping an application cycle to rewrite TOEFL (If it can be rewritten), do more research on funding and explore other funding options ahead of next year's application.
