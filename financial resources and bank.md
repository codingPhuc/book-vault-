	It sounds like you're looking for a mix of great customer service, a solid mobile app, and good loan options. Based on what you've said and what others have shared:
	- **Chase** has a top-tier app but lacks in customer service.
	- **US Bank** seems to offer great personalized service, which you value, but you'd need to check if their app meets your expectations.
	- **Capital One** gets a lot of praise for its online experience, but has some quirks like limited account linking.
	- **Credit Unions & Community Banks** tend to excel in service and loans but often lack the best apps.
	- **Ally, Alliant, & Other Online Banks** offer high savings rates and solid apps but lack physical branches.
	- **Schwab & Fidelity** are great if you want investment features along with banking.
	If mobile banking is a top priority, Capital One or Ally could be worth looking into. If you’re after personal service, a credit union or community bank may be your best bet. Since you like US Bank’s in-person experience, testing their app before switching might be a good idea. Have you considered running a small test account with them first?

	If you’re looking for convenience and lots of branch locations, Chase is a common choice, but several users warn against it due to reports of **random account closures** and **poor customer service**. Many people in the thread **strongly recommend credit unions**, especially **Logix**, for their **excellent customer service**—like real humans answering calls quickly and even greeting you by name.
	That said, Logix comes with a few downsides: they perform a **hard credit pull** just to open a basic account, their **app can be glitchy**, **branches have limited locations and parking**, and **card disputes** require a manual form upload. They may also require more documentation for credit applications, and their **ATMs lack flexible withdrawal options**.
	Other highly praised credit unions include:
	**Wescom** – strong on fraud alerts, instant card replacements, and overdraft flexibility.
	First Entertainment CU**, **California Credit Union (formerly LA Teachers)**, **SchoolsFirst**, **Premier America**, **Partners**, and **LAFCU** – all highlighted for **reliability**, **ATM access**, **customer support**, and **community-focused banking**
	One user noted that **credit unions in CA use a co-op ATM network**, meaning you can often use a variety of ATMs (including those at 7-Elevens) with **no fees**. Another person mentioned **signing up for bank promotions** (via sites like HustlerMoneyBlog) to rotate between banks for **sign-up bonuses**—but this is more about gaming the system than long-term loyalty.
	Overall, the consensus is that **credit unions beat big banks** in service and transparency, even if they lack some convenience features or tech polish.

Avoid taking on loans that exceed the future earning potential of the degree by too large of a factor. Use the [debt/salary wizard](https://mappingyourfuture.org/paying/debtwizard/index.cfm#debtWizard) to determine the suggested maximum amount of debt you should incur based upon your projected salary or what salary you should be earning based upon your current debt



## Credit

- College is often when young adults start building credit via student loans and credit cards, but it's also when a lot of people start a long relationship with expensive debt.
    
- If you are responsible with money and have income, applying for a [credit card](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/creditcards) can be a reasonable move for many people. This is different than the debit card your bank will provide with your account. It's a very good way to independently establish credit without paying interest. A [student credit card](https://clark.com/credit-cards/best-student-credit-cards/) or [secured credit card](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/top-credit-cards/nerdwallets-best-secured-credit-cards/) is probably your best option. Read the [credit building wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/credit_building) for more advice on this topic.
    
- Pay the balance in full every month! If you can't do that or you're not sure if you are ready, then you should not get a credit card. You can always build credit later when you have a more steady income and more experience handling money.
