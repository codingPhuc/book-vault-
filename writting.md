[How to Prewrite: Prewriting Tips for Generating Ideas | Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/prewrite/) 
1. **Clustering Prewriting:**
    
    - Central Idea: **Sustainability in Urban Planning**
    - Secondary Ideas: Green spaces, public transportation, renewable energy, community gardens, waste management.
    - Clusters: Connect ‘green spaces’ to ‘community health’, ‘renewable energy’ to ‘long-term cost savings’, etc.
2. **Freewriting Prewriting:**
    
    - Prompt: **The impact of technology on education**
    - Freewriting Example: “Technology has revolutionized education by providing access to online resources. However, it also presents challenges such as digital distraction and the digital divide…”
3. **Looping Prewriting:**
    
    - Initial Topic: **Healthy Eating Habits**
    - Loop 1: General thoughts on diet trends.
    - Loop 2: Focus on plant-based diets.
    - Loop 3: Benefits of plant-based diets on personal health.
    - Loop 4: Environmental impact of plant-based diets.
    - Loop 5: How to transition to a plant-based diet.
4. **Listing Prewriting:**
    
    - Broad Topic: **Climate Change**
    - List: Carbon emissions, deforestation, ocean acidification, renewable energy, policy changes.
    - Grouped: ‘Carbon emissions’ and ‘deforestation’ under ‘Causes’, ‘renewable energy’ and ‘policy changes’ under ‘Solutions’.
5. **Question-Asking Prewriting:**
    
    - Central Idea: **The decline of bee populations**
    - Who? Beekeepers, farmers, environmentalists.
    - What? Causes of decline, consequences, and solutions.
    - Where? Global issue, with significant impacts in agricultural regions.
    - When? Noticed over the past few decades.
    - Why? Pesticides, habitat loss, climate change.
    - How? Conservation efforts, policy changes, public awareness campaigns.

Exactly! You’ve got the essence of the looping prewriting technique. It’s about:

1. **Listing out all ideas** that come to mind without judgment or censorship.
2. **Identifying the most recurring idea** or theme that emerges from your initial list.
3. **Focusing on that idea** by exploring it further in another freewriting session.
4. **Moving to the next most common idea** and repeating the process.

This method helps you to prioritize your ideas based on their recurrence and significance, which can lead to a more organized and focused piece of writing. It’s a great way to develop your thoughts and narrow down your topic to the most relevant points. Keep practicing this technique, and you’ll find it becomes a natural part of your writing process.

# Basic understanding 
- An **adjective** modifies a noun by providing more detail or clarification, making the meaning more specific and understandable. For example, “a **tall** building” – here, “tall” is the adjective modifying the noun “building.”
    
- A **noun** represents an object, person, place, thing, or idea in the real world or in thought. It’s the subject or object of a sentence. For example, “The **building** is tall” – “building” is the noun in this sentence.
    
- A **verb** represents the action taken by the noun or the state of being. It’s the word that tells us what the noun is doing. For example, “The man **runs** fast” – “runs” is the verb showing the action taken by the noun “man.”
    
So, in a sentence, the noun is what we’re talking about, the adjective describes the noun, and the verb tells us what the noun is doing. This structure helps create clear and informative sentences.

## Task 1  
 IELTS Writing requires you to put in a lot of effort. To be able to "achieve" a perfect score, in addition to complete content, you need to pay attention to accurate grammar, rich [vocabulary](https://ielts.idp.com/vietnam/prepare/article-ielts-vocabulary-writing-task-1) , and scoring phrases and prepositions in the lesson. 

This article will introduce an overview, chart types in [[IELTS Writing Task 1]] and tips to help you improve your writing skills effectively.
## Task  2 
In the [[IELTS Writing  Task 2]] is the part that accounts for more points, and of course is more difficult than [Task 1](https://ielts.idp.com/vietnam/prepare/article-ielts-writing-task-1) . Let's read through the basic information and score scale so you can have an overall view of this test.
# writing tips  
Em, chị chỉ tip này hay lắm. Mỗi lần viết bài xong copy- paste qua chatgpt, type "fix _______". Nó sẽ polish câu chữ chính xác với ideas hơn. Còn nếu muốn xem điểm thật thì cài đặt Grammarly, nó sẽ chấm từ Grammar, Vocabulary, Ease of Comprehension và Communication Vibe. Chung chung là vậy.

Góp ý chi tiết thì bài của em ý hơi non yếu, ko có liên hệ ví dụ minh họa sống động. Chủ đề này mà ko đàm điệu vụ li dị của Johnny Depp và Amber Heard, hay vụ chú Will Smith slap Chris Rock là ko thức thời rồi. 🤣

Còn nữa, hạn chế sử dụng "should, should not, do not have a right to". Mấy từ này chỉ dùng trong văn bản hành chính và điều lệ hợp đồng. Sử dụng trong context freedom of speech là cực kì chướng mắt, ở North America sẽ bị ăn gạch nhé. Reviewer đọc đến đó thôi là dẹp bài luôn, chứ ko chấm đâu.

Nhìn chung là vốn từ khá, cấu trúc câu thì hơi luộm thuộc, có thể rút ngắn lại một nửa. Your opinion piece chưa có nổi trội và cuốn hút cho lắm. Khuyến khích đọc nhiều news pieces, hay blogposts, mấy trang lá cải như Vice cũng đc. 😅

I just wrote: here is the question and answer of my IELTS writing task 1/2, please check it based on IELTS criteria and rate 0 to 9 to each of my writing skills. I also sometimes asked to develop my writing or just correct the mistakes.

Hey thank you first of all, Secondly the most important thing i believe is to understand how IELTS is marked. What the examiners are looking for, once that is crystal clear in your head, i believe you can deliver your answers better. Reading is merely practicing, there's no shortcut to it. However when it comes to writing and listening, you can use certain tips to cut the corners or marginally get better on exam day. For writing, I've answered it before as well. Be sure to stick to the format and answer what's being asked. Same goes for listening, oftentimes in listening they might ask for "one word and/or a number" but we may write two words or two numbers, silly mistakes yk. Be sure to make a rough outline of your essay in writing so as to aid the flow and get a much more free flowing write-up. For listening again in part 3&4 be sure to notice keywords in questions. Those are the ones that they'll paraphrase and you'll have to keep an eye out for them. Mostly you'll get the answer if you do it right. And arguably the most nerve wrecking part, Speaking. Now believe it or not, I did not use one single high level vocab or idioms in speaking. Since I am not a native speaker, I was stressed about my accent, really stressed. But guess what? They don't care about your accent as long as you are understandable. Yes pronunciation matters mostly because wrongly pronounced words can cause misunderstandings, again circling back to " as long as you are understandable" Speak as if they will not judge you if you share your thoughts, take pauses and really take deep breaths. The more oxygen goes in your brain, the more in control you'll feel, the better you'll be able to think. IELTS isn't really complicated, we make it so. Good luck and all the best.

As for practice material, i used the IELTS book that you get after booking your test mostly and for listening i used some Cambridge-book audios


## summary 
The user shares a writing tip: after writing a piece, copy and paste it into a chatbot (like GPT-3) and ask it to “fix” the text. This can help polish the language and clarify ideas. They also recommend using Grammarly for a detailed assessment of grammar, vocabulary, comprehension, and communication vibe.

They critique a piece of writing, noting that it lacks vivid illustrative examples. They suggest that current events, like the divorce of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard or the incident between Will Smith and Chris Rock, could be used to make the piece more relevant and engaging.

They advise against using phrases like “should”, “should not”, and “do not have a right to” in the context of freedom of speech, as these can be off-putting, especially in North America. They warn that reviewers may reject pieces containing these phrases.

They compliment the writer’s vocabulary but find the sentence structure somewhat clumsy and suggest that the piece could be shortened. They feel that the opinion piece lacks standout features and isn’t very engaging. They recommend reading news pieces, blog posts, and even tabloid-style sites like Vice for inspiration and improvement.

In the second part, they share their experience with IELTS preparation. They stress the importance of understanding how IELTS is marked and what examiners are looking for. They believe that reading requires practice and there are no shortcuts. For writing and listening, they suggest certain tips can help improve performance on the exam day.

For writing, they advise sticking to the format and answering what’s being asked. They also suggest making a rough outline of the essay to aid the flow of writing. For listening, they recommend paying attention to keywords in questions, as these are often paraphrased in the listening material.

For speaking, they share that they did not use high-level vocabulary or idioms and were initially stressed about their accent. However, they found that examiners don’t care about accents as long as the speech is understandable. They suggest speaking naturally, taking pauses, and breathing deeply to aid thinking. They believe that IELTS isn’t complicated, but students often make it so.

Finally, they mention that they used the official IELTS book and Cambridge audios for practice material. They believe these resources were helpful in their preparation.
